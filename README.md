# Tools we use for the Mostly Security Podcast
Our basic tools for Workflow:
* [Facetime](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facetime/id1110145091) for our remote comms
* [Piezo](https://rogueamoeba.com/piezo/) for recording the Facetime calls (mostly for backup)
* [QuickTime](https://support.apple.com/downloads/quicktime) for recording individual audio feeds (also mostly for backup)
* [Audio Hijack](https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/) for the main individual audio feeds
* [Ferrite](https://www.wooji-juice.com/products/ferrite/) for combining and editing (this has generally replaced Audacity)
* [Forecast](https://overcast.fm/forecast) to add in all the fancy ID3 tags and chapter markers, etc
* [Libsyn](https://www.libsyn.com/) for hosting the podcast 
* [GitHub](https://www.github.com/mostlysecurity) for hosting the [Mostly Security](https://mostlysecurity.com) homepage and any tools we build

# Tools

### pullmetada.py
After we have created the Forecast MP3 with titles, chapter, urls, etc; we were doing a bit of hand editing the Libsyn blog page.  This tools simply extracts the ID3 tags and outputs to JSON, Markdown or HTML.  It is very much a work in progress, and tailored to how we publish stuff into libsyn, but it was a simple optimization to save some time.
